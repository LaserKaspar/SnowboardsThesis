# SnowboardsThesis

This is the Diploma-Thesis that accompanies our Game-Project "Tricks 'N' Treats". 

```
This thesis is about the development of Tricks 'n' Treats, an asymmetric local-multiplayer game.
The first part of the thesis deals with the technical development of asymmetric virtual reality games, with a special focus on performance optimization, the problems that were encountered and technical limitations of asymmetric virtual reality games.
The second part discusses how the dynamics between PC and VR are formed, how to influence them and, in the case of the game, how to construct a good interaction between the two worlds. 
The third part of the work explores the world and atmosphere of the game. In particular, it is devoted to how color and shape design influences the feelings and actions of the players. 
The last part deals with 3D modeling and specifically addresses the performance optimization of 3D-game-assets. Thereby a big focus is on the research and use of different optimization methods and their advantages and disadvantages.
