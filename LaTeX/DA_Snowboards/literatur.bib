@inproceedings{_mda,

	Dynamics, and Aesthetics), developed and taught as part of the Game
	Design and Tuning Workshop at the Game Developers Conference, San
	Jose 2001-2004.
	
	MDA is a formal approach to understanding games --- one which attempts
	to bridge the gap between game design and development, game criticism,
	and technical game research. We believe this methodology will clarify
	and strengthen the iterative processes of developers, scholars and
	researchers alike, making it easier for all parties to decompose,
	study and design a broad class of game designs and game artifacts.},
