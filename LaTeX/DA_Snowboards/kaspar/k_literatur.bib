	Design and Tuning Workshop at the Game Developers Conference, San

	MDA is a formal approach to understanding games --- one which attempts
	to bridge the gap between game design and development, game criticism,
	and technical game research. We believe this methodology will clarify
	and strengthen the iterative processes of developers, scholars and
	researchers alike, making it easier for all parties to decompose,
	study and design a broad class of game designs and game artifacts.},

	publisher={Palgrave Macmillan UK},
	address={London},
	pages={29--40},
	abstract={Despite the importance of fun in entertainment, there exists remarkably little research into its nature and function. Drawing extensively on empirical evidence from entertainment examples, McKee proposes a simple definition: fun is `pleasure without purpose', where pleasure is understood to be `doing something that you want to do'. In this chapter McKee explains that this apparently banal definition has radical implications for our thinking about how culture works. He shows that this basic definition functions in two ways. There exists a solipsistic version of fun---anything can be fun if you do it for pleasure (algebra can be fun). But there also exists a consensual, mainstream understanding of fun---sex, drugs, and rock `n' roll.},
